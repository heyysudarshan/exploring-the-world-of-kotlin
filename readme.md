### Trying Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern, concise, and expressive language packed with helpful features that make coding more enjoyable and
efficient. Its clean syntax allows you to write code that is concise, readable, and easy to maintain.

This module lists essential Kotlin features with code snippets to help you get started or refresh your knowledge. For a
deeper understanding, explore the [official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html).

Here's the list of topics I've covered:

1. Writing a basic `Hello World` program.
2. Displaying output with `println()`.
3. Printing multi-line text using triple quotes `""" """`.
4. Writing single-line and multi-line comments.
5. Declaring immutable variables with `val`.
6. Declaring mutable variables with `var`.
7. Using **string template** to embed variables in strings.
8. Using **template expressions** to embed expressions inside strings.
9. Common data types: `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `Char`, and `Double`.
10. Defining a function using the `fun` keyword
11. Writing a function that returns a value
12. Creating a function with parameters
13. Calling a function using named arguments
14. Defining a function with default parameter values
15. Implementing two functions: one with a block body and another with an expression body.
16. Iterating in Kotlin using a `for` loop
17. Iterating in Kotlin using a `while` loop
18. Iterating in Kotlin using a `do-while` loop

### Practice solutions

This module contains all the coding challenges Iâ€™ve solved using Kotlin. It starts with very basic programs, which Iâ€™ve
included intentionally. I believe these small programs help you get familiar with the syntax and understanding of the
language, and then you can gradually increase the challenge level after a certain point.

1. Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

2. Write a function that takes an integer minute and converts it to seconds.

### Thank you ðŸ™Œ

I'm glad you checked out this repository. I understand the struggle of learning a new language or transitioning to
another one. Believe meâ€”youâ€™ll soon start loving Kotlin more than anything.

When I first started, I loved Java and JavaScript. I never imagined Kotlin would replace them, but here I am. Now, every
other language feels awkward to me. All the best, and welcome to the world of Kotlin. Thank you so much for checking
this out!
