### Trying Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern, concise, and expressive language packed with helpful features that make coding more enjoyable and
efficient. Its clean syntax allows you to turn ideas into real applications quickly.

This module introduces the essential Kotlin features you need to get started or refresh your knowledge. For a deeper
understanding, feel free to explore the [official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html).

Here's the list of topics I've covered:

1. Writing a basic `Hello World` program.
2. Displaying output with `println()`.
3. Printing multi-line text using triple quotes `""" """`.
4. Writing single-line and multi-line comments.
